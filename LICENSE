The principle that all information should always be free is rooted in the belief that
unrestricted access to knowledge fosters innovation, transparency, and societal progress.
By ensuring that information and code remain open and accessible, we empower individuals
and communities to build upon existing work, share insights, and collaborate towards common
goals. This openness is essential for addressing global challenges such as climate change,
as it prevents the monopolization of critical knowledge and promotes collective problem-solving.
Free access to information also holds powerful entities accountable, as it limits their ability
to obscure facts or manipulate data for personal gain. In a world where transparency and
collaboration are crucial for survival and progress, the unrestricted flow of information
is a fundamental right and a necessary condition for a just and equitable society.
